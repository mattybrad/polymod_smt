# PolyMod SMT test

This will be a small polyphonic digital modular synthesizer, using a Teensy 3.2. The design is based on my tutorial from Hackspace magazine (issue 17), and was also featured in the Book of Making (volume 2). Currently this is a work in progress, so don't go ordering any PCBs just yet. This is really just a project for me to get some practice designing with surface-mount components and specifying for a pick-and-place machine, which I haven't done before.
